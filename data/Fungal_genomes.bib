  abstract = {The emergence of azole-resistant strains of Aspergillus fumigatus during treatment for aspergillosis occurs by a mutation selection process. Understanding how antifungal resistance mechanisms evolve in the host environment during infection is of great clinical importance and biological interest. Here, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations that arose during infection by A. fumigatus strains sequentially isolated from two patients, one with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (five isolations) and the other with aspergilloma (three isolations). The serial isolates had identical microsatellite types, but their growth rates and conidia production levels were dissimilar. A whole-genome comparison showed that three of the five isolates from the IPA patient carried a mutation, while 22 mutations, including six nonsynonymous ones, were found among three isolates from the aspergilloma patient. One aspergilloma isolate carried the cyp51A mutation P216L, which is reported to confer azole resistance, and it displayed an MIC indicating resistance to itraconazole. This isolate harbored five other nonsynonymous mutations, some of which were found in the afyap1 and aldA genes. We further identified a large deletion in the aspergilloma isolate in a region containing 11 genes. This finding suggested the possibility that genomic deletions can occur during chronic infection with A. fumigatus. Overall, our results revealed dynamic alterations that occur in the A. fumigatus genome within its host during infection and treatment.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Illumina DNA sequencing is now the predominant source of raw genomic data, and data volumes are growing rapidly. Bioinformatic analysis pipelines are having trouble keeping pace. A common bottleneck in such pipelines is the requirement to read, write, sort and compress large BAM files multiple times.Results: We present SAMBLASTER, a tool that reduces the number of times such costly operations are performed. SAMBLASTER is designed to mark duplicates in read-sorted SAM files as a piped post-pass on DNA aligner output before it is compressed to BAM. In addition, it can simultaneously output into separate files the discordant read-pairs and/or split-read mappings used for structural variant calling. As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime. As a stand-alone duplicate marking tool, it performs significantly better than PICARD or SAMBAMBA in terms of both speed and memory usage, while achieving nearly identical results.Availability and implementation: SAMBLASTER is open-source C++ code and freely available for download from https://github.com/GregoryFaust/samblaster.Contact:imh4y@virginia.edu},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are the key players in gene expression and their study is highly significant for shedding light on the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary history of organisms. During host–pathogen interaction, extensive reprogramming of gene expression facilitated by TFs is likely to occur in both host and pathogen. To date, the knowledge about TF repertoire in filamentous fungi is in infancy. The necrotrophic fungus Ascochyta rabiei, that causes destructive Ascochyta blight (AB) disease of chickpea (Cicer arietinum), demands more comprehensive study for better understanding of Ascochyta-legume pathosystem. In the present study, we performed the genome-wide identification and analysis of TFs in A. rabiei. Taking advantage of A. rabiei genome sequence, we used a bioinformatic approach to predict the TF repertoire of A. rabiei. For identification and classification of A. rabiei TFs, we designed a comprehensive pipeline using a combination of BLAST and InterProScan software. A total of 381 A. rabiei TFs were predicted and divided into 32 fungal specific families of TFs. The gene structure, domain organization and phylogenetic analysis of abundant families of A. rabiei TFs were also carried out. Comparative study of A. rabiei TFs with that of other necrotrophic, biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, symbiotic, and saprotrophic fungi was performed. It suggested presence of both conserved as well as unique features among them. Moreover, cis-acting elements on promoter sequences of earlier predicted A. rabiei secretome were also identified. With the help of published A. rabiei transcriptome data, the differential expression of TF and secretory protein coding genes was analyzed. Furthermore, comprehensive expression analysis of few selected A. rabiei TFs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed variety of expression patterns during host colonization. These genes were expressed in at least one of the time points tested post infection. Overall, this study illustrates the first genome-wide identification and analysis of TF repertoire of A. rabiei. This work would provide the basis for further studies to dissect role of TFs in the molecular mechanisms during A. rabiei–chickpea interactions.},

  abstract = {Constant evolutionary pressure acting on pathogens refines their molecular strategies to attain successful pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that pathogenicity mechanisms of necrotrophic fungi are far more intricate than earlier evaluated. However, only a few studies have explored necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Ascochyta rabiei is a necrotrophic fungus that causes devastating blight disease of chickpea (Cicer arietinum). Here, we report a 34.6 megabase draft genome assembly of A. rabiei. The genome assembly covered more than 99\% of the gene space and 4,259 simple sequence repeats were identified in the assembly. A total of 10,596 high confidence protein-coding genes were predicted which includes a large and diverse inventory of secretory proteins, transporters and primary and secondary metabolism enzymes reflecting the necrotrophic lifestyle of A. rabiei. A wide range of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes capable for degradation of complex polysaccharides were also identified. Comprehensive analysis predicted a set of 758 secretory proteins including both classical and non-classical secreted proteins. Several of these predicted secretory proteins showed high cysteine content and numerous tandem repeats. Together, our analyses would broadly expand our knowledge and offer insights into the pathogenesis and necrotrophic lifestyle of fungal phytopathogens.},

In addition, a brief overview of available comparative genomics and visualization tools is provided to assist investigators along the course of biological discovery.

However, the quality of the sampled genomes can vary greatly which hampers utility for comparisons and meaningful interpretation. The uncertainty of the completeness of a given genome sequence can limit feasibility of asserting patterns of high rates of gene loss reported in many lineages. Results: We propose a computational framework and sequence resource for assessing completeness of fungal genomes called FGMP (Fungal Genome Mapping Project). Our approach is based on evolutionary conserved sets of proteins and ultra conserved DNA elements and is applicable to various types of genomic data. We present a comparison of FGMP with state-of-the-art methods utilizing 246 genome assemblies of fungi. We discuss genome assembly improvements/degradations in 56 two-point fungal genome assemblies, as recorded by NCBI assembly archive.

  abstract = {With the rapid accumulation of publicly available small RNA sequencing datasets, third-party meta-analysis across many datasets is becoming increasingly powerful. Although removing the 3´ adapter is an essential step for small RNA sequencing analysis, the adapter sequence information is not always available in the metadata. The information can be also erroneous even when it is available. In this study, we developed DNApi, a lightweight Python software package that predicts the 3´ adapter sequence de novo and provides the user with cleansed small RNA sequences ready for down stream analysis. Tested on 539 publicly available small RNA libraries accompanied with 3´ adapter sequences in their metadata, DNApi shows near-perfect accuracy (98.5\%) with fast runtime (\textasciitilde{}2.85 seconds per library) and efficient memory usage (\textasciitilde{}43 MB on average). In addition to 3´ adapter prediction, it is also important to classify whether the input small RNA libraries were already processed, i.e. the 3´ adapters were removed. DNApi perfectly judged that given another batch of datasets, 192 publicly available processed libraries were “ready-to-map” small RNA sequence. DNApi is compatible with Python 2 and 3, and is available at https://github.com/jnktsj/DNApi. The 731 small RNA libraries used for DNApi evaluation were from human tissues and were carefully and manually collected.
